# Film Annotation

This application allows the creation, editing, and deletion of film annotations, associated with specific tags, providing an organized way to catalog information.

It utilizes advanced JavaScript functionalities, including the use of conditionals (if, throw, else), operators (!, !=, ===), as well as complex techniques for automation and database manipulation including the use of “cascade delete” for better management.

### Objective

Built using Node.js and Express.js to create a RESTful API. It uses the SQLite database to store information related to films, notes, and tags.

We created a server with Node.js and Express.js to create a RESTful API. We used SQLite and SQLite3 for data persistence related to films, notes, and tags. We worked with SQL queries through Knex, using migrations to create and update the database schema. We developed CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionalities to manage film notes and tags associated with them. We tested and validated the API routes using Insomnia to interact with the endpoints. We configured and managed the SQLite database visually using Beekeeper Studio.
